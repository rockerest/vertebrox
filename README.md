backbone/ is where the real magic happens.

I do love my global/ files, but that's a personal preference thing.
There's a global CSS (with reset, and some useful styling that takes a lot of pain out of setting up a new site), and some javascript stuff that I use sometimes.

jquery/ is any jQuery plugins that I've written (it's just one right now).

If you're interested in this repo, what you probably want is the stuff in backbone/.  I also recommend you take a look at global/, but the stuff in there is personal preference.
