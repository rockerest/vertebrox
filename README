backbone/ is where the real magic happens.

I do love my global/ files, but that's a personal preference thing.

jquery/ has a few plugins I use, as well as a little plugin I wrote.

If you're interested in this repo, what you probably want is the stuff in backbone/.  I also recommend you take a look at global/, but the stuff in there is personal preference.
