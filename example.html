The following image was created in MSPaint.
<br />
<img src="portrait.png" alt="portrait" />
<br />
The following image was edited by myframework with the following code:
<br />
<code>
	$img = new Image();
	<br />
	$img->source('portrait.png');
	<br />
	$img->Write->Normal(20, 20, "A Self Portrait of Me", 5, "#000000", 1);
	<br />
	$img->destination('portrait2.png');
	<br />
	$img->output();
	<br />
	$img->clean();
	<br />
	unset($img);
</code>

You can use <code>throw new RedirectBrowserException("url");</code> to use <code>header('Location: url');</code> even after headers have been sent.
<hr />
This is a session variable: <code><?= $_SESSION['foo']; ?></code>
<hr />
At this moment, <code>URL.php</code> is exclusively a <code>.phps</code> syntax highlighter.
<br />
I pass any url that hits my server requesting <code>*.phps</code> through that file so that I can serve those kinds of files.
<br />
For an example, point your browser to <a href="http://www.thomasrandolph.info/test/index.phps">this demo</a>.

The functions and their parameters of the Image library are as follows:
<br />
<code>
	//places the image in the destination, or to the default output if no destination is specified<br />
	//returns boolean success or failure<br />
	bool Image->output();
	<br />
	<br />
	//copies the image object<br />
	//returns new image object<br />
	Image Image->copy();
	<br />
	<br />
	//checks whether the destination is set, and whether the destination file already exists<br />
	//returns false if destination isn't set, boolean whether file at destination exists<br />
	bool Image->check();
	<br />
	<br />
	//returns a string formatted for header('Content-type:');<br />
	string Image->ContentType();
	<br />
	<br />

	//possibly very large, you should always call this when you're done<br />
	//returns true.  Always.<br />
	bool Image->clean();
</code>
<br />
The functions and their parameters of the Image->Combine library are as follows:

	<br />
	<br />
	Where:
	<br />
	$overimg is an Image object to put on TOP of the current object<br />
	$destination_x and _y is the location on the current object to place the top left corner of the overlay image<br />
	$source_x and _y is the new location of the top left corner of the overlay image (0,0 usually works well)<br />
	$source_width and _height is the amount of pixels to grab from the overlay image ($overimg->width and $overimg->height usually work well)<br />
	$alpha is how transparent the overlaid image should be, from .00 to 1.0<br />
</code>
<br />
The functions and their parameters of the Image->Draw library are as follows:
<br />
<code>
	//draws a circle<br />
	//returns boolean for success/failure<br />

	Where:
	<br />
	$x and $y is the location on the image to draw the center<br />
	$r is the radius of the circle<br />
	$color is the hex color of the circle<br />
	$filled is [0|1] whether the circle should be filled or not<br />

	//returns boolean for success/failure<br />
	boolean Image->Draw->Rectangle($x, $y, $w, $h, $color, $filled = false, $alpha = 1)
	<br />
	<br />
	Where:
	<br />
	$x and $y is the location on the image to draw the center<br />
	$w and $h are the width and height, respectively, of the rectangle to draw<br />
	$color is the hex color of the rectangle<br />
	$filled is [0|1] whether the rectangle should be filled or not<br />
	$alpha is how transparent the rectangle should be, from .00 to 1.0<br />
	<br />
	//draws a line<br />
	//returns boolean for success/failure<br />
	boolean Image->Draw->Line($x1, $y1, $x2, $y2, $color, $alpha = 1)
	<br />
	<br />
	Where:
	<br />
	$x1 and $y1 is the location on the image to draw the line FROM<br />
	$x2 and $y2 is the location on the image to draw the line TO<br />
	$color is the hex color of the line<br />
	$alpha is how transparent the line should be, from .00 to 1.0<br />

The functions and their parameters of the Image->Manipulate library are as follows:
<br />
<code>
	//resizes an image<br />
	//returns boolean for success/failure<br />
	boolean Image->Manipulate->Resize($newWidth, $newHeight, $stretch = true)
	<br />
	<br />
	Where:
	<br />
	$newWidth and $newHeight is the intended resulting image size.<br />
	$stretch determines the actual output.<br />
	If true, the source image is compressed to fit in the dimensions specified.<br />
	If false, the largest dimension will be determined, and the image will be scaled so that that dimension matches<br />
	<br />
	//scales an image<br />
	//returns boolean for success/failure<br />
	boolean Image->Manipulate->Scale($percent)
	<br />
	<br />
	Where:
	<br />
	$percent is a number >= 1 to scale the image to.  Numbers larger than 100 require a fairly significant about of memory.<br />
	Numbers larger than 1000 are utterly insane<br />
	<br />
	//crops an image<br />
	//returns boolean for success/failure<br />
	boolean Image->Manipulate->Crop($top, $right, $bottom, $left)
	<br />

	<br />
	///Writes text in any TrueType font<br />
	//returns boolean for success/failure<br />
